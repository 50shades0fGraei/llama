Here's a Pytest framework to test your AI model's conversational capabilities:

            "user_response": "AI has revolutionized healthcare and finance. However, concerns about job displacement and bias persist.",
            "expected_opinion_keywords": ["healthcare", "finance", "bias"],
            "expected_question_keywords": ["regulation", "ethics"]
        },
        # Add more scenarios
    ]

def test_conversational_opinion_formation(model, conversation_scenarios):

        user_response = scenario["user_response"]
        
        # Model provides opinion and follow-up question
        opinion, follow_up_question = model.respond(user_response)

        # Assert follow-up question contains expected keywords
        assert any(keyword in follow_up_question for keyword in scenario["expected_question_keywords"])
```

# AI Model Requirements
1. `ask_question()`: Returns the model's initial question.
2. `respond(user_response)`: Takes user input, returns opinion and follow-up question.
3. Update `your_model.py` to implement these methods.

# Example AI Model Implementation
```
class AIModel:
    def ask_question(self):
        return "What are your thoughts on AI?"
    
    def respond(self, user_response):
        # Tokenize user response
        tokens = user_response.split(".")
        
        # Form opinion based on knowledge graph and user input
        opinion = "AI impacts " + ", ".join([token.split()[0] for token in tokens])
        
        # Generate follow-up question
        follow_up_question = "How do you think AI regulation should address these concerns?"
        
        return opinion, follow_up_question
